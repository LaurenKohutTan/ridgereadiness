      <h2> Advice from current RHS students!</h2>
       <p>
         Jillian Lipset (Class of 2026): Just be yourself; not everyone is going to like you; don't change yourself for others.
<br><br>
         Dan Rafanello (Class of 2026): Work hard, but enjoy it and have fun!
<br><br>
         Hasini Namburi (Class of 2026): High school will be different and any amount of preparation cannot prep you enough. Stay happy throughout and be with people who help you stay happy. 
<br><br>
         Ava Yiu (Class of 2026): Try to plan out what classes you want to take in your 4 years here early on. There was a lot I would have wanted to do if I had planned it out better. And don't forget to get your credits in!
<br><br>
         Luke Lee (Class of 2026): Make lots of friends and you'll do just fine.
<br><br>
         Sophia Cheenath (Class of 2027): I recommend keeping a planner + don't procrastinate. Often times people have problems with task initiation, so even doing a task for just a few minutes can get you started on what you need to do. Procrastination just creates more problems the further up you go in high school so make sure to eliminate that soon!
<br><br>
         Sarah Ramirez (Class of 2026): High school will shape you, but remember--you are your thoughts, and by shifting your perspective, you hold the power to either romanticize your life or be miserable in it.
<br><br>
         Honorary mentions: <br>
         Jackie Tang (Class of 2027): Use your study halls wisely. 
         <br>Shlok Janani (Class of 2028): lock in freshman yr or cooked

How current Ridge students feel their Ridge experience is compared to Middle School (1 star is worse, 5 stars is much better):

         Ridge is definitely a much better experience than middle school, and even though you have more homework, you'll most likely enjoy it so much more!
